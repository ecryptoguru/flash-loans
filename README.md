# Flash Loans Testing

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
mkdir flash-loans
cd flash-loans
npm init --yes
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
npx hardhat
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts @aave/core-v3 dotenv
npx hardhat test
```
